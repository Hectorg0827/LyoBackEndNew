# Security Guidelines

This document outlines security guidelines and best practices for the Lyo backend.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Implementation

- **Tokens**: The system uses JWT for authentication with two types of tokens:
  - **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (default: 1 day)
  - **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived (default: 7 days)
- **Token Storage**: Tokens should be stored securely by clients:
  - Access tokens in memory
  - Refresh tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies or secure storage
- **Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated when used

### Password Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a cost factor of 12
- Password requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

### Role-Based Access Control

User roles include:
- **Regular Users**: Standard access to all user features
- **Admin Users**: Administrative capabilities for user management

## API Security

### Rate Limiting

- **Per-Minute Limit**: 60 requests per minute per IP (configurable)
- **Per-Day Limit**: 10,000 requests per day per IP (configurable)
- **Whitelisted Paths**: Some endpoints like health checks are exempt
- **Admin IPs**: Configurable list of IPs that bypass rate limiting

### Input Validation

- All API inputs are validated using Pydantic models
- Strict validation enforced for all request bodies
- Sanitization applied to prevent XSS and injection attacks

### CORS Configuration

- CORS origins are configurable via environment variables
- Production settings should restrict to specific trusted domains
- Development allows broader access for testing

## Secrets Management

### Environment Variables

- Sensitive information is stored in environment variables
- Environment-specific .env files should never be committed to version control
- Production secrets should be managed by a secure secrets manager

### Security Headers

The API automatically includes the following security headers:
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Configured for API use
- **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains

## Data Security

### PII Handling

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is encrypted at rest
- Access to PII is strictly controlled and audited
- Data is minimized to only what's necessary for functionality

### Database Security

- Database credentials are never hardcoded
- Database connections use TLS encryption
- Parameterized queries used to prevent SQL injection
- Separate user roles for different database operations

## Auditing & Monitoring

### Logging

- **Request ID Tracking**: Each request has a unique ID for tracing
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format for machine parsing
- **Log Levels**: Configuration to control verbosity
- **PII Masking**: Personal data is masked in logs

### Security Events

The following events are logged with high priority:
- Authentication failures
- Authorization failures
- Rate limiting triggers
- Admin operations
- Database schema changes

## Security Response

### Vulnerability Reporting

- Email: security@lyo.app
- Responsible disclosure policy in place
- Bug bounty program available

### Incident Response

1. **Identification**: Detect and classify the incident
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

## Security Updates

- Dependencies are regularly updated to patch vulnerabilities
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular security reviews of code and architecture

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Ensures user data rights, consent management
- **CCPA**: Provides data access and deletion capabilities
- **SOC 2**: Controls for security, availability, and confidentiality

## Recommended Practices for Deployments

- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement DDoS protection
- Use TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites
- Regularly rotate all credentials and secrets
- Conduct regular security penetration testing
